## ⚠️ Important Warning About GenP

### What is GenP?

`GenP`, short for "Generic Patcher," is a tool designed to extend the trial periods of `Adobe Creative Cloud` software on `Windows` systems. It modifies certain system files to reset the trial timer, effectively allowing users to use Adobe applications like `Photoshop` and `Premiere Pro` without a valid subscription.

### Risks of Using GenP

#### Legal Risks

  - Using tools like `GenP` to bypass copyright protections constitutes software piracy, which is illegal in most countries, including Vietnam.

#### Security Risks

  - Cracking tools often come with malware, viruses, or ransomware. They may require administrative privileges and disabling antivirus software, creating significant security vulnerabilities.

### Disclaimer

> This guide does not endorse or encourage the use of tools like `GenP`. It is provided solely for educational purposes to raise awareness about the associated risks.

### 📝 Note about the `Source Code` folder

> The `Source Code` folder may not be updated to the latest version. Please follow the instructions in the [README file](#installation-requirements) to download the latest version from GitHub.

## 🏁 Getting Started

Follow the steps in this guide to easily and safely install Adobe applications for free.

## 👣 Step-by-Step Guide

### Phase 1: 🧹 Preparation and Thorough Uninstallation

The goal of this phase is to ensure your computer is completely "clean" of any old Adobe versions to avoid conflicts during installation.

#### Uninstall All Adobe Applications

Before proceeding, make sure to uninstall all existing Adobe applications (such as `Photoshop`, `Illustrator`, `Premiere`, and especially `Adobe Creative Cloud`) from your computer.

  - Use your preferred uninstallation method (e.g., via Windows `"Apps & features"` or specialized uninstallation tools) to ensure all leftover files and registry keys are thoroughly removed.

#### Download Required Tools

Download the necessary files mentioned in this guide to proceed with the installation.

### 📥 Installation Requirements

#### Adobe Creative Cloud

  - Download the official Adobe Creative Cloud application from the [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/download/creative-cloud).

#### GenP

  - Download `GenP` (GP) from its official source: [GenP](https://gen.paramore.su/).

### Phase 2: ☁️ Installing Creative Cloud (CC)

Now you will install Adobe's main management tool.

#### Steps:

1.  Run the `"Creative Cloud"` installer.
2.  Click `"Continue"` and log in using your account (Gmail/Adobe).
3.  **Important Note**: During the installation process, if a popup window appears, make sure to **uncheck** the box for `Adobe Genuine Service (AGS)` before proceeding.
4.  Wait for Creative Cloud to finish installing.

### Phase 3: ⚙️ Configuration and Activation Preparation

Before activation, you need to configure Creative Cloud (CC) and disable your antivirus software.

#### Configure Creative Cloud:

1.  Open the Creative Cloud application you just installed.

2.  Click on the menu (three-dot icon) -\> `File` -\> `Reference`.

3.  Turn off all three settings:

      * `Launch Creative Cloud at login`
      * `Run Creative Cloud in the background after closing`
      * `Automatically keep Creative Cloud up to date`
      * Refer to the image below for reference:

4.  Click `"Done"`.

5.  Go back to `File` -\> `Quit` to ensure the application is completely closed.

#### ⚠️ Disable Antivirus (Important):

1.  Open `"Windows Security"`.
2.  Navigate to `"Virus & threat protection"` -\> `"Manage settings"`.
3.  Temporarily turn **Off** the `"Real-time protection"` option.
      * This step ensures that the `"GB"` tool is not blocked during the process.

### Phase 4: 🔑 Activation (Using Adobe GB)

This is the software "cracking" step.

#### Steps:

1.  **Extract and Run Adobe GB**:

      * Extract the `"Adobe GB"` file.
      * Right-click on the executable and select `"Run as administrator"`.

2.  **Activate Creative Cloud**:

    > **Note**: If you installed the application in a custom directory, make sure to patch accordingly. If you used the default directory, no additional steps are needed.

      * In the `"GB"` tool, click the `"Search"` button.
      * Once the scan is complete, click the `"P" (Patch)` button to bypass the payment requirement.

3.  **Install Applications**:

      * Open `Creative Cloud`.
      * Navigate to the `"App"` section and select the application you want to install (e.g., `Photoshop`), then click `"Install"`.
      * Wait for the application to finish installing.

4.  **Activate Applications (Second Time)**:

      * After the application (e.g., `Photoshop`) is installed, close `Creative Cloud`.
      * Reopen the `"Adobe GB"` tool (`Run as administrator`).

    > **Note**: If you installed the application in a custom directory, make sure to patch accordingly. If you used the default directory, no additional steps are needed.

      * Click `"Search"` again to detect the newly installed application.
      * Click the `"P" (Patch)` button to activate the specific application.

### Phase 5: 🛡️ Blocking Internet Connection

The final step is to prevent the application from connecting to Adobe's servers.

#### Steps:

1.  **Use Adobe GB's Popup Tool**:

      * Open the `"Adobe GB"` tool and switch to the `"Popup tool"` tab.
      * Locate the second option (referred to as `"File one"` in the video, possibly `"Firewall"`).

2.  **Add Firewall Rules**:

      * Click the `"Add rule"` button.
      * Select `"Select all"` and then click `"OK"`.

3.  **Complete the Process**:

      * You can now re-enable your antivirus software (**`Real-time protection`**) that was disabled in Phase 3.
