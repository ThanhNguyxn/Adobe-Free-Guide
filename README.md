### 🤔 What is GenP?

`GenP`, short for "Generic Patcher," is a tool designed to extend the trial periods of `Adobe Creative Cloud` software on `Windows` systems. It modifies certain system files to reset the trial timer, effectively allowing users to use Adobe applications like `Photoshop` and `Premiere Pro` without a valid subscription.

### 🚫 Risks of Using GenP

#### ⚖️ Legal Risks

  - Using tools like `GenP` to bypass copyright protections constitutes software piracy, which is illegal in most countries, including Vietnam.

#### ☣️ Security Risks

  - Cracking tools often come with malware, viruses, or ransomware. They may require administrative privileges and disabling antivirus software, creating significant security vulnerabilities.

### 📜 Disclaimer

> This guide does not endorse or encourage the use of tools like `GenP`. It is provided solely for educational purposes to raise awareness about the associated risks.

### 📝 Note about the `Source Code` folder

> The `Source Code` folder may not be updated to the latest version. Please follow the instructions in the [Installation Requirements](#-installation-requirements) section to download the latest version from GitHub.

### Phase 1: 🧹 Preparation and Thorough Uninstallation

The goal of this phase is to ensure your computer is completely "clean" of any old Adobe versions to avoid conflicts during installation.

#### 1. Uninstall All Adobe Applications

Before proceeding, make sure to uninstall all existing Adobe applications (such as `Photoshop`, `Illustrator`, `Premiere`, and especially `Adobe Creative Cloud`) from your computer.

  - Use your preferred uninstallation method (e.g., via Windows `"Apps & features"` or specialized uninstallation tools) to ensure all leftover files and registry keys are thoroughly removed.

#### 2. Download Required Tools

Download the necessary files mentioned in the [Installation Requirements](#-installation-requirements) section.

### Phase 2: ☁️ Installing Creative Cloud (CC)

Now you will install Adobe's main management tool.

1.  Run the `Creative Cloud` installer.
2.  Click `Continue` and log in using your account (Gmail/Adobe).
3.  **Important Note**: During the installation process, if a popup window appears, make sure to **uncheck** the box for `Adobe Genuine Service (AGS)` before proceeding.
4.  Wait for Creative Cloud to finish installing.

### Phase 3: ⚙️ Configuration and Activation Preparation

Before activation, you need to configure Creative Cloud (CC) and disable your antivirus software.

#### 1. Configure Creative Cloud

1.  Open the Creative Cloud application you just installed.
2.  Click on the menu (three-dot icon) -> `File` -> `Reference`.
3.  Turn off all three settings:
      * ❌ `Launch Creative Cloud at login`
      * ❌ `Run Creative Cloud in the background after closing`
      * ❌ `Automatically keep Creative Cloud up to date`
4.  Click `Done`.
5.  Go back to `File` -> `Quit` to ensure the application is completely closed.

#### 2. ⚠️ Disable Antivirus (Important)

1.  Open `Windows Security`.
2.  Navigate to `Virus & threat protection` -> `Manage settings`.
3.  Temporarily turn **Off** the `Real-time protection` option.
      * This step ensures that the `GB` tool is not blocked during the process.

### Phase 4: 🔑 Activation (Using Adobe GB)

This is the software "cracking" step.

1. **Install and run Adobe GB**:

      * Download the `Adobe GB` tool from the official source.
      * Extract the downloaded file to a folder on your computer.
      * Locate and run the `run_build.bat` file by double-clicking it.
      * The process will automatically create a `Release` folder containing the main executable file for `Adobe GB`.
      * Right-click on the `Adobe GB` executable file and select `Run as administrator` to launch the tool.

2.  **Activate Creative Cloud**:

      * In the `GB` tool, click the `Search` button.
      * Once the scan is complete, click the `P (Patch)` button to bypass the payment requirement.

3.  **Install Applications**:

      * Open `Creative Cloud`.
      * Navigate to the `App` section and select the application you want to install (e.g., `Photoshop`), then click `Install`.
      * Wait for the application to finish installing.

4.  **Activate Applications (Second Time)**:

      * After the application (e.g., `Photoshop`) is installed, close `Creative Cloud`.
      * Reopen the `Adobe GB` tool (`Run as administrator`).
      * Click `Search` again to detect the newly installed application.
      * Click the `P (Patch)` button to activate the specific application.

### Phase 5: 🛡️ Blocking Internet Connection

The final step is to prevent the application from connecting to Adobe's servers.

1.  **Use Adobe GB's Popup Tool**:

      * Open the `Adobe GB` tool and switch to the `Popup tool` tab.
      * Locate the second option (referred to as `File one` in the video, possibly `Firewall`).

2.  **Add Firewall Rules**:

      * Click the `Add rule` button.
      * Select `Select all` and then click `OK`.

3.  **Complete the Process**:

      * You can now re-enable your antivirus software (`Real-time protection`) that was disabled in Phase 3.
